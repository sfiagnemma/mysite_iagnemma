    "text": "Narrative Journalism November 5, 2020\nThe Robinson Township Judge of Elections calls me up at the eleventh hour when one of her clerks drops out. Apparently I’ve got a bit of a reputation as someone vaguely interested in politics, so she offers me a spot working at the polls on November 3rd. I am sent the 61-page Election Officer Handbook and instructed that under no circumstances is a sweet, impressionable voter to have any clue what my personal affiliations are. My favorite tassel cap is blue… should I risk it? I suppose I’ll wear my grey hat instead. Voting in the Montour High School gym today is a laughably simple process; voters fill out ballots and drop them into a box. Of course, the ballots are painstakingly accounted for, come in a few different breeds, and the “box” is a DS200, a tallying computer which can accept ballots forwards, backwards, and upside down. These and other details make everything seem more complicated. Every extra word you have to say to a voter is a hurdle. It doesn’t help that the system is different this year than last year. Occasional voters ask what ever happened to the computers, the easier computers, where they could just click on a candidate to vote for them. Why the change? Well, the DS200 scanner – my judge of elections calls it the R2D2 – is a security upgrade. The DS200 has a paper trail, where the old computers didn’t. There was no way to prove later what calculations the old computers had done to reach their totals. But this year, at the end of the night, after our machine counts the votes and prints them in a results slip, the judge of elections and I will pop open R2D2’s belly and send the completed ballots back to the county. Each of those ballots corresponds to a signature in our sign-in book, which lists every valid voter in the district alphabetically. Five hundred votes in the ballot box will have to equal five hundred John Hancocks in the book, or, at the very least, we’ll have to be able to explain the discrepancy. If you’re the portly man who pulled our judge aside for five minutes to debate security, this system clearly isn’t enough. Can’t ballots be falsified? Can’t we feed fake votes into the machine? “Yes, sir,” I wanted to say. “In fact, as soon as you leave, we’ll be stuffing this here refrigerator full of votes against your favorite candidate. And when the county calls us up tomorrow and asks why on god’s green earth we’ve got six hundred cast votes unaccounted for in our sign-in book, not to mention missing from the unvoted ballot box, we’ll just tell ’em not to worry their pretty little heads about it.” But alas, at the end of the night, we do our jobs. The ballots are packed, sealed, and left in authorized custody, and I go home. I awaken the next morning to news of the President griping about potential mail-in fraud…"

    "text": "Texas House Bill 20 Essay\nAn essay I completed in fall of 2022 about Texas’s House Bill 20.\n\nBackground\nIn 2021, the Texas House of Representatives passed Texas House Bill 20, typically shortened to HB 20, a law which prohibits social media platforms from discriminating against user-generated content based on viewpoint. The title of the legislation is, “An Act Relating to censorship of or certain other interference with digital expression, including expression on social media platforms or through electronic mail messages,” which reveals the motivation behind the law; the Texas House of Representatives seeks to prevent perceived political censorship on social media. The law defines censorship more explicitly, and states that platforms may not “edit, alter, block, ban, delete, remove, deplatform, demonetize, de-boost, regulate, restrict, inhibit the publication or reproduction of, or deny equal access or visibility to expression, to suspend a right to post, remove, or post an addendum to any content or material posted by a user, or to otherwise discriminate against expression.” A social media platform under HB 20 is defined to include search engines, websites, systems, and software providers, so long as they are open to the public, allow platform users to create an account, and enable users to communicate with other users by posting content. The law is specified to apply only to platforms with greater than 50 million monthly American users. It is a broad-reaching definition that captures a great deal of what might be considered “the internet.” HB 20 does not, however, deign to define what content might be considered a user’s “viewpoint.” After the law was passed, the organization of internet corporations known as NetChoice and the Computer & Communications Industry Association sued Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. In September of 2022, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals released their ruling, which found the law to be constitutional. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals found a similar law in Florida to be unconstitutional in the case NetChoice v. Attorney General, State of Florida. The Supreme Court will examine the law soon, and in the meantime, HB 20 has been suspended pending appeal.\n\n\nFifth Circuit Holding\nThe Fifth Circuit court holds that HB 20 does not infringe on any First Amendment rights held by the platforms. The court emphasized the distance between platforms and their user-generated content; platforms can “say whatever they want to distance themselves from the speech they host.” Unlike social media, traditional media forms involve a great deal of editorial discretion. Newspapers, for example, are held responsible for the speech of their writers, and therefore, the newspaper itself enjoys some related First Amendment protections, as well as some responsibilities. Platforms’ relationship to their content is entirely different. The Fifth Circuit holds that platforms “exercise virtually no editorial control or judgement.” This characterization separates mere content moderation from constitutionally protected speech, in the Fifth Circuit’s view. The Fifth Circuit believes that in order to strike the law as unconstitutional under the First Amendment, the law must either compel or restrict the platform’s speech. Having determined that content moderation is not speech in and of itself, there was no further ground for arguing that the law contained an unconstitutional mandate.\n\n\nIssue 1. The language of HB 20 is not precise enough with regard to platform.\nThe question of whether platforms have a “right” to censor is a critically important one, but HB 20 appears patently unconstitutional before that inquiry even needs to be addressed. Its language is far too broad to be acceptable of any law even incidentally curtailing speech. The terms outlined in HB 20 appear to be more restrained than they actually are. Prohibiting “social media” “censorship” based on “viewpoint” sounds at face like a legitimate government interest. Fostering productive discussion and innovation was the entire purpose behind Section 230. The state has an interest in keeping Internet discussion free, unchilled, and diverse, and preventing individuals from having their Tweets or YouTube videos hidden due only to their political affiliation is a reasonable concern. This, however, is not the only type of communication HB 20 targets. For example, banning the modification of a community-generated forum to remove or correct incorrect, biased, or misleading information presented as fact – such as that which might appear on Wikipedia – is not a compelling or even genuine government interest. And yet, HB 20’s language explicitly says that platforms may not “edit” or “alter” user-generated content on any platform with greater than 50 million users that, “is open to the public, allows a user of the platform to create an account, and enables a user to communicate with other users for the primary purpose of posting information, comments, messages, or images.” An even cursory glance at the definitions of the terms provided in HB 20 reveals that the law tumbles headlong into unexpected sections of internet communication. Those arguing for the law’s constitutionality must not only be held to explaining the government’s interest in protecting political speech in the arena of public discourse, but also in sections of the internet where user-generated content is detached from the user and/or presented as fact alone. In order to be constitutional, the law would first have to be more carefully tailored to exclude online media where the purpose of posting content is informational, rather than for discussion. Wikipedia still serves as a great example; there should be no doubt that Wikipedia has the right to edit or clarify incorrect information on their platform, because the entire purpose of the platform is the presentation of fact. Does the government have a genuine and important interest in protecting viewpoint-based speech that is intended not to enrich discourse, but only to deceive? Such would be the effect on a number of platforms. If not, HB 20 appears unconstitutional under intermediate scrutiny, as the Fifth Circuit used in their examination of the law in September.\n\n\nIssue 2. The language of HB 20 is not precise enough with regard to viewpoint.\nA great deal of the language in HB 20 is painstakingly defined – “social media,” “censorship,” “user,” “expression,” and even “receive” are all examples. One term is conspicuously absent; nowhere does HB 20 define what is meant by “viewpoint,” which ought to be the most important term in the entire law. “Viewpoint” could, and likely does, refer to a broad variety of content, such as religious, social, or political speech. It likely includes the subjects usually implicated in First Amendment discussion. However, viewpoints could also be interpreted to include a wide range of other beliefs and opinions, from international politics to pop culture and everything in between. In that case, the word itself becomes universal, and consequently meaningless. If all content is “viewpoint-based,” HB 20 seeks to prohibit the censorship of all content. Indeed, it is harder to imagine content that does not conceivably implicate some sort of value or framework. A photograph of a family pet could imply a “viewpoint” about animal rights. This ambiguity raises another important question: is HB 20 content-based? The Fifth Circuit held that the law was not content-based, but surely the difference between a post espousing a certain viewpoint and a post with no viewpoint is a content-based distinction. It is impossible to be sure without a definition of the word. To the law’s credit, the word “viewpoint” could be deliberately undefined, in order to emphasize the breadth of speech HB 20 seeks to protect. In this case, determining what censorship is “viewpoint-based” would be left to the platforms themselves, and to the courts when the law comes into effect. This is not a valid defense of the language’s lack of clarity, however, since the Supreme Court has stricken down laws for this very reason. Legislative vagueness can be a violation of the Constitution. The Court ruled in Connally v. General Construction Co. that a law is unconstitutionally vague if a person “of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning.” The Supreme Court has held that vague legislation poses a threat to due process, enables arbitrary discrimination on the part of law enforcement, and chills lawful exercise of First Amendment rights, all three of which are of concern in the case of HB 20.\nIn that case, the Texas House’s motivation behind the lack of clarity in HB 20 is moot, because it fails to anticipate the myriad issues that may arise as a result. It is not difficult to imagine a scenario in which language favorable to the state is deemed to contain some kind of “viewpoint,” while that which is not is left unprotected. Conversely, a vindictive state could choose to interpret any moderation at all as hostile viewpoint-based censorship, in order to take punitive swipes at a platform of which they did not approve. A platform could halt all content moderation in order to avoid running afoul of HB 20, subjecting users to the kind of “toxic” environment previous legislation like Section 230 sought to prevent; spam, which is commonly filtered out by algorithms, could very well be viewpoint-motivated, if it has some sort of political, social, or religious agenda. The Court should find that HB 20 is improperly tailored to address the government interest it intends to suit, by potentially including all user-generated content, and contains unconstitutionally vague language.\n\n\nIssue 3. The Caveat\nAccepting that HB 20 runs afoul of constitutionality because of its language, the Supreme Court could, hypothetically, strike the law down without making any comment on censorship. However, it ought to be said that the Platforms’ assertion that government prohibition of political censorship is a violation of their free speech rights is ridiculous. The Fifth Circuit, though flawed in their analysis, made a number of important observations in their discussion of HB 20. First, no reasonable user of a platform would mistake an individual’s post for the beliefs of the platform. On platforms of the scale that HB 20 targets, content contradicts itself. To pick out a single post or attitude and say that it reflects the will of a platform is to disregard the volume of other content found there. Moreover, as the Fifth Circuit pointed out, HB 20 does nothing to prevent platforms from making their own statements regarding the content on their sites. Functionally, a social media site hosting a user’s speech is not perceived as speech on the part of the site, and therefore should not be governed in that manner. Second, the First Amendment was not written with this scenario in mind. Over the last 200 years, the street-corner, protected by the First Amendment, has become a less effective site for speech than the privately-owned Platform. Public speech is now dependent on the benevolence of private corporations, rather than the benevolence of the government. The Fifth Circuit acknowledges that the government cannot compete with private platforms in providing internet space for public discourse. What is left for governments looking to secure public free speech for individuals? They can only hope to impart upon corporations – by culture or by legislation – the same values to which they themselves are held. The purpose of the First Amendment was to protect private citizens from government censorship. The question now is which part of that objective the Court finds more important: the rights of the private, or the protection from censorship – whether it chooses to prioritize the rights of companies, or of citizens. Social media platforms self-regulate in ways that affect the everyday lives of millions of Americans. These are not elected officials, not subject to the accountability we expect of our government, and not beholden to any objectives above profit.\nThere is no enshrined right for a social media platform to censor its users, yet, even though it is broadly held that some moderation is acceptable. Corporations do have certain protected free speech rights; cases such as Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission and Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. indicate as much. It is reasonable to argue that the prioritization of certain content at the expense of other content is expressive; it is reasonable to argue that censorship itself is expressive. It is clear that, as of yet, censorship exists in a grey area. On its face it infringes upon the behavior of private citizens, but is itself a private action. The most dangerous thing that the Supreme Court could do would be to take HB 20 as an opportunity to codify censorship as a right. Private companies have in the past and will continue to vie for this, but acquiescing would be a mistake. To the extent that the government can protect First Amendment rights in the private sphere, it has a vested interest to do so. If the Supreme Court grants any ground to the platforms claiming they have a right to censorship, they surrender free speech itself to the hands of corporations."

    "text": "This is a piece I wrote for my advanced news reporting class in the fall of 2022.\nStudents at Georgetown University will be the only source of contraceptives on campus for their peers this fall. Georgetown University, a Catholic institution, has never provided students with worn or pharmaceutical contraceptives. That role has been taken up by H*yas for Choice, a student group not officially recognized by the university.\nH*yas for Choice was founded under the name GU Choice in 1991. Reporting from the school newspaper, The Hoya, and several others, indicates that Georgetown administration initially recognized the club but sparked a backlash from the student and faculty communities. The opposition culminated in requests for a canon suit submitted to Pope John Paul II to revoke the school's Catholic status, which caused school administrators to disavow the student organization in 1992. H*yas for Choice has operated outside of Georgetown University's recognition ever since.\nMembers said that since they receive no funding from the institution, they operate on donations and sometimes pay out of pocket to supply GU students with contraceptives. Being unaffiliated with the school also requires the asterisk in the club's name – according to the H*yas for Choice website, the term \"hoya\" is trademarked by Georgetown University, so outside organizations are prohibited from using it.\nWhen asked about H*yas for Choice and the school's contraceptives policy, Georgetown University representatives made no comment.\nEmma Barenbaum, a junior member of H*yas for Choice, said that one of the club's methods is to encourage students to become \"condom ambassadors\" by hanging envelopes containing condoms on the outside of their dorm room door.\n\"Legally, the university can't touch, can't take down anything we put on the doors, because the doors are considered our property while we're living in there,\" Barenbaum said.\nJunior H*yas for Choice member Marieteresa Porcher said that the club also offers the emergency contraceptive pill known as Plan B. Students can email the club and meet with one of its members to get the pill. Porcher said that there was \"no judgement\" for students asking for Plan B.\nPorcher said that H*yas for Choice also makes use of free speech policies on campus to set up a table in Red Square, a space often used for protest. Students have historically been able to stop by the table to pick up lubricant, condoms, and informational materials. Last week, H*yas for Choice offered humorous boxed condoms with pictures of endangered species on them.\n\"Right now, our condoms say, 'extinction is forever – wear a condom,' because of overpopulation,\" Barenbaum said, \"So, avoid procreating so the animals can procreate. We try to add a little bit of funniness into it.\"\nBarenbaum and Porcher both said that their club has a generally positive relationship with the student body, though the school does have a significant anti-abortion population.\nStudents in H*yas for Choice and in GU's Right to Life club said that the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization this summer raised the stakes on GU's campus. The Right to Life club has no official stance on contraception, but members emphasized Georgetown's history as a Catholic institution.\n\"Catholic universities should promote that culture of life and dignity for all students,\" said Alissa Keegan, president of GU Right to Life. Keegan said that GU Right to Life is a service-oriented club that focuses on supporting young mothers and advocating against abortions. Keegan said GU Right to Life does receive funding from Georgetown University and that the club's budget is handled and approved by a student advisory board.\nKeegan said H*yas for Choice is a relatively popular club on campus, and anti-abortion attitudes at GU were \"more prevalent than you'd expect at a Catholic university.\"\nElizabeth Oliver, a freshman representative in GU Right to Life, said that the school's religious affiliation is a significant presence for students. \"There are Jesuit values all over campus,\" she said.\n\"Georgetown is a Catholic school. Students who go to Georgetown know that,\" Oliver said.\nOliver said that GU, being in DC, was in a \"tricky position.\" GU is the largest school in DC which does not offer contraceptives of any kind to its students. Being in a city which appears largely pro-abortion creates some tension on campus, Oliver said, but she said she also believes that GU should continue to assert their religious commitment, even if it is unpopular.\n\"The Jesuit tradition has always been about education, going out and teaching people, and bringing people in,\" Oliver said.  \nThe Catholic University of America also does not provide birth control, emergency contraceptives, or condoms to enrolled students. American University, which is affiliated with the United Methodist Church, does provide contraceptives, including Plan B.\nGeorge Washington University, the University of the District of Columbia and Gallaudet University are not religiously affiliated, and all provide contraceptives through their student health services. The Student Association of George Washington University is considering plans to make Plan B available to students by selling it in vending machines located in residence halls.\nYan Xu, vice president of GWU's Student Association, said access to reproductive health support like contraceptives makes education more accessible to people with reproductive ability.\nLinsi Goodin, GWU Student Association Senator, said an abstinence-only approach to reproductive health is \"unrealistic in this world.\"\nWhen asked about such possibilities on Georgetown University's campus, Barenbaum said, \"I wish. It's never going to happen here.\"\n\"As long as the Catholic Church is not supporting contraceptives, Georgetown University is not going to provide us access to contraceptives,\" Barenbaum said.\nBarenbaum and Porcher said they are both proud to be part of the student body of GU, without necessarily being proud of the school's administration. Barenbaum said that while she would not discourage potential students from attending Georgetown University, the inaccessibility of contraceptives was an important \"caveat\" that she would give.\n\"Especially if those students are interested in being involved in, you know, a pro-choice club like this, just be aware, the university won't support you,\" Porcher said."

    "text": "First Person Narrative Practice\nThis is a piece I wrote for my narrative journalism class in the fall of 2020.\nThe Robinson Township Judge of Elections calls me up at the eleventh hour when one of her clerks drops out. Apparently I’ve got a bit of a reputation as someone vaguely interested in politics, so she offers me a spot working at the polls on November 3rd.\nI am sent the 61-page Election Officer Handbook and instructed that under no circumstances is a sweet, impressionable voter to have any clue what my personal affiliations are. My favorite tassel cap is blue… should I risk it? I suppose I’ll wear my grey hat instead.\nVoting in the Montour High School gym today is a laughably simple process; voters fill out ballots and drop them into a box.\nOf course, the ballots are painstakingly accounted for, come in a few different breeds, and the “box” is a DS200, a tallying computer which can accept ballots forwards, backwards, and upside down. These and other details make everything seem more complicated. Every extra word you have to say to a voter is a hurdle.\nIt doesn’t help that the system is different this year than last year. Occasional voters ask what ever happened to the computers, the easier computers, where they could just click on a candidate to vote for them.\nWhy the change? Well, the DS200 scanner – my judge of elections calls it the R2D2 – is a security upgrade. The DS200 has a paper trail, where the old computers didn’t. There was no way to prove later what calculations the old computers had done to reach their totals.\nBut this year, at the end of the night, after our machine counts the votes and prints them in a results slip, the judge of elections and I will pop open R2D2’s belly and send the completed ballots back to the county. Each of those ballots corresponds to a signature in our sign-in book, which lists every valid voter in the district alphabetically.\nFive hundred votes in the ballot box will have to equal five hundred John Hancocks in the book, or, at the very least, we’ll have to be able to explain the discrepancy.\nIf you’re the portly man who pulled our judge aside for five minutes to debate security, this system clearly isn’t enough. Can’t ballots be falsified? Can’t we feed fake votes into the machine?\n“Yes, sir,” I wanted to say. “In fact, as soon as you leave, we’ll be stuffing this here refrigerator full of votes against your favorite candidate. And when the county calls us up tomorrow and asks why on god’s green earth we’ve got six hundred cast votes unaccounted for in our sign-in book, not to mention missing from the unvoted ballot box, we’ll just tell ’em not to worry their pretty little heads about it.”\nBut alas, at the end of the night, we do our jobs. The ballots are packed, sealed, and left in authorized custody, and I go home.\nI awaken the next morning to news of the President griping about potential mail-in fraud…"

    "section": "",
    "text": "An essay I completed in fall of 2022 about Texas’s House Bill 20, as a midterm for my media law class.\n\nBackground\nIn 2021, the Texas House of Representatives passed Texas House Bill 20, typically shortened to HB 20, a law which prohibits social media platforms from discriminating against user-generated content based on viewpoint. The title of the legislation is, “An Act Relating to censorship of or certain other interference with digital expression, including expression on social media platforms or through electronic mail messages,” which reveals the motivation behind the law; the Texas House of Representatives seeks to prevent perceived political censorship on social media. The law defines censorship more explicitly, and states that platforms may not “edit, alter, block, ban, delete, remove, deplatform, demonetize, de-boost, regulate, restrict, inhibit the publication or reproduction of, or deny equal access or visibility to expression, to suspend a right to post, remove, or post an addendum to any content or material posted by a user, or to otherwise discriminate against expression.” A social media platform under HB 20 is defined to include search engines, websites, systems, and software providers, so long as they are open to the public, allow platform users to create an account, and enable users to communicate with other users by posting content. The law is specified to apply only to platforms with greater than 50 million monthly American users. It is a broad-reaching definition that captures a great deal of what might be considered “the internet.” HB 20 does not, however, deign to define what content might be considered a user’s “viewpoint.” After the law was passed, the organization of internet corporations known as NetChoice and the Computer & Communications Industry Association sued Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. In September of 2022, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals released their ruling, which found the law to be constitutional. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals found a similar law in Florida to be unconstitutional in the case NetChoice v. Attorney General, State of Florida. The Supreme Court will examine the law soon, and in the meantime, HB 20 has been suspended pending appeal.\n\n\nFifth Circuit Holding\nThe Fifth Circuit court holds that HB 20 does not infringe on any First Amendment rights held by the platforms. The court emphasized the distance between platforms and their user-generated content; platforms can “say whatever they want to distance themselves from the speech they host.” Unlike social media, traditional media forms involve a great deal of editorial discretion. Newspapers, for example, are held responsible for the speech of their writers, and therefore, the newspaper itself enjoys some related First Amendment protections, as well as some responsibilities. Platforms’ relationship to their content is entirely different. The Fifth Circuit holds that platforms “exercise virtually no editorial control or judgement.” This characterization separates mere content moderation from constitutionally protected speech, in the Fifth Circuit’s view. The Fifth Circuit believes that in order to strike the law as unconstitutional under the First Amendment, the law must either compel or restrict the platform’s speech. Having determined that content moderation is not speech in and of itself, there was no further ground for arguing that the law contained an unconstitutional mandate.\n\n\nIssue 1. The language of HB 20 is not precise enough with regard to platform.\nThe question of whether platforms have a “right” to censor is a critically important one, but HB 20 appears patently unconstitutional before that inquiry even needs to be addressed. Its language is far too broad to be acceptable of any law even incidentally curtailing speech. The terms outlined in HB 20 appear to be more restrained than they actually are. Prohibiting “social media” “censorship” based on “viewpoint” sounds at face like a legitimate government interest. Fostering productive discussion and innovation was the entire purpose behind Section 230. The state has an interest in keeping Internet discussion free, unchilled, and diverse, and preventing individuals from having their Tweets or YouTube videos hidden due only to their political affiliation is a reasonable concern. This, however, is not the only type of communication HB 20 targets. For example, banning the modification of a community-generated forum to remove or correct incorrect, biased, or misleading information presented as fact – such as that which might appear on Wikipedia – is not a compelling or even genuine government interest. And yet, HB 20’s language explicitly says that platforms may not “edit” or “alter” user-generated content on any platform with greater than 50 million users that, “is open to the public, allows a user of the platform to create an account, and enables a user to communicate with other users for the primary purpose of posting information, comments, messages, or images.” An even cursory glance at the definitions of the terms provided in HB 20 reveals that the law tumbles headlong into unexpected sections of internet communication. Those arguing for the law’s constitutionality must not only be held to explaining the government’s interest in protecting political speech in the arena of public discourse, but also in sections of the internet where user-generated content is detached from the user and/or presented as fact alone. In order to be constitutional, the law would first have to be more carefully tailored to exclude online media where the purpose of posting content is informational, rather than for discussion. Wikipedia still serves as a great example; there should be no doubt that Wikipedia has the right to edit or clarify incorrect information on their platform, because the entire purpose of the platform is the presentation of fact. Does the government have a genuine and important interest in protecting viewpoint-based speech that is intended not to enrich discourse, but only to deceive? Such would be the effect on a number of platforms. If not, HB 20 appears unconstitutional under intermediate scrutiny, as the Fifth Circuit used in their examination of the law in September.\n\n\nIssue 2. The language of HB 20 is not precise enough with regard to viewpoint.\nA great deal of the language in HB 20 is painstakingly defined – “social media,” “censorship,” “user,” “expression,” and even “receive” are all examples. One term is conspicuously absent; nowhere does HB 20 define what is meant by “viewpoint,” which ought to be the most important term in the entire law. “Viewpoint” could, and likely does, refer to a broad variety of content, such as religious, social, or political speech. It likely includes the subjects usually implicated in First Amendment discussion. However, viewpoints could also be interpreted to include a wide range of other beliefs and opinions, from international politics to pop culture and everything in between. In that case, the word itself becomes universal, and consequently meaningless. If all content is “viewpoint-based,” HB 20 seeks to prohibit the censorship of all content. Indeed, it is harder to imagine content that does not conceivably implicate some sort of value or framework. A photograph of a family pet could imply a “viewpoint” about animal rights. This ambiguity raises another important question: is HB 20 content-based? The Fifth Circuit held that the law was not content-based, but surely the difference between a post espousing a certain viewpoint and a post with no viewpoint is a content-based distinction. It is impossible to be sure without a definition of the word. To the law’s credit, the word “viewpoint” could be deliberately undefined, in order to emphasize the breadth of speech HB 20 seeks to protect. In this case, determining what censorship is “viewpoint-based” would be left to the platforms themselves, and to the courts when the law comes into effect. This is not a valid defense of the language’s lack of clarity, however, since the Supreme Court has stricken down laws for this very reason. Legislative vagueness can be a violation of the Constitution. The Court ruled in Connally v. General Construction Co. that a law is unconstitutionally vague if a person “of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning.” The Supreme Court has held that vague legislation poses a threat to due process, enables arbitrary discrimination on the part of law enforcement, and chills lawful exercise of First Amendment rights, all three of which are of concern in the case of HB 20.\nIn that case, the Texas House’s motivation behind the lack of clarity in HB 20 is moot, because it fails to anticipate the myriad issues that may arise as a result. It is not difficult to imagine a scenario in which language favorable to the state is deemed to contain some kind of “viewpoint,” while that which is not is left unprotected. Conversely, a vindictive state could choose to interpret any moderation at all as hostile viewpoint-based censorship, in order to take punitive swipes at a platform of which they did not approve. A platform could halt all content moderation in order to avoid running afoul of HB 20, subjecting users to the kind of “toxic” environment previous legislation like Section 230 sought to prevent; spam, which is commonly filtered out by algorithms, could very well be viewpoint-motivated, if it has some sort of political, social, or religious agenda. The Court should find that HB 20 is improperly tailored to address the government interest it intends to suit, by potentially including all user-generated content, and contains unconstitutionally vague language.\n\n\nIssue 3. The Caveat\nAccepting that HB 20 runs afoul of constitutionality because of its language, the Supreme Court could, hypothetically, strike the law down without making any comment on censorship. However, it ought to be said that the Platforms’ assertion that government prohibition of political censorship is a violation of their free speech rights is ridiculous. The Fifth Circuit, though flawed in their analysis, made a number of important observations in their discussion of HB 20. First, no reasonable user of a platform would mistake an individual’s post for the beliefs of the platform. On platforms of the scale that HB 20 targets, content contradicts itself. To pick out a single post or attitude and say that it reflects the will of a platform is to disregard the volume of other content found there. Moreover, as the Fifth Circuit pointed out, HB 20 does nothing to prevent platforms from making their own statements regarding the content on their sites. Functionally, a social media site hosting a user’s speech is not perceived as speech on the part of the site, and therefore should not be governed in that manner. Second, the First Amendment was not written with this scenario in mind. Over the last 200 years, the street-corner, protected by the First Amendment, has become a less effective site for speech than the privately-owned Platform. Public speech is now dependent on the benevolence of private corporations, rather than the benevolence of the government. The Fifth Circuit acknowledges that the government cannot compete with private platforms in providing internet space for public discourse. What is left for governments looking to secure public free speech for individuals? They can only hope to impart upon corporations – by culture or by legislation – the same values to which they themselves are held. The purpose of the First Amendment was to protect private citizens from government censorship. The question now is which part of that objective the Court finds more important: the rights of the private, or the protection from censorship – whether it chooses to prioritize the rights of companies, or of citizens. Social media platforms self-regulate in ways that affect the everyday lives of millions of Americans. These are not elected officials, not subject to the accountability we expect of our government, and not beholden to any objectives above profit.\nThere is no enshrined right for a social media platform to censor its users, yet, even though it is broadly held that some moderation is acceptable. Corporations do have certain protected free speech rights; cases such as Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission and Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. indicate as much. It is reasonable to argue that the prioritization of certain content at the expense of other content is expressive; it is reasonable to argue that censorship itself is expressive. It is clear that, as of yet, censorship exists in a grey area. On its face it infringes upon the behavior of private citizens, but is itself a private action. The most dangerous thing that the Supreme Court could do would be to take HB 20 as an opportunity to codify censorship as a right. Private companies have in the past and will continue to vie for this, but acquiescing would be a mistake. To the extent that the government can protect First Amendment rights in the private sphere, it has a vested interest to do so. If the Supreme Court grants any ground to the platforms claiming they have a right to censorship, they surrender free speech itself to the hands of corporations."
